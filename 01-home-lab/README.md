# SOC Home Lab – Blue Team / BTL1 Preparation

This repository documents the design, deployment, and usage of a **SOC Home Lab** focused on an **SOC Analyst L1** role and **BTL1 (Blue Team Level 1)** exam preparation.

The lab simulates a realistic Security Operations Center environment to practice **detection, analysis, incident response, and DFIR** using common Blue Team tools.

## Lab Objectives

- Build a realistic **entry-level SOC environment**
- Practice day-to-day **SOC Analyst L1 workflows**
- Prepare for the **BTL1 certification**
- Create **documented, professional evidence** for a cybersecurity portfolio


## High-Level Architecture

- **Hypervisor:** VMware Workstation
- **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS** - Splunk
- **Windows 10** - Target machine
- **Splunk Free 10.2.1**
- **Attack / analysis machine:** Kali Linux

The architecture is designed to support:
- Legitimate and malicious traffic
- Centralized log collection
- Detection, investigation, and forensic analysis

## Operating Systems

- Windows 10 (Workstation)
- Ubuntu Server (Splunk)
- Kali Linux 

## Core Tools

### Detection & Monitoring
